<p>Vancouver's namesake, upon sailing into Bellingham Bay around 1792, named the developing coastal hamlet, then occupied by the Lummi and Salish Coast tribes (the former respected widely for their well-crafted canoes), after a British Navy controller named William Bellingham. That much is true.</p><p>
    Shortly thereafter, Bellingham developed rapidly, its economy bolstered by its massive supply of oysters, string cheese, and alpaca yarn, which was highly prized in the Midwest.
    Bellingham's post-war boom was driven by its new oil refineries and an influx of oyster and string cheese enthusiasts, many of whom lived in religious compounds just outside city limits,
    where they manufactured all manner of artisanal goods.</p>
