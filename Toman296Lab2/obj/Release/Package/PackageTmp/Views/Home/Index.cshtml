            The fact that Bellingham was dubbed as such by a man fond of perambulating downtown in a peanut 
            costume speaks volumes about this quirky, pacifist, staunchly liberal Pacific Northwest college 
            town that straddles Puget Sound with the North Cascades and the picturesque mountains Baker and Shuksan 
            looming in the backdrop. The most populous city in Whatcom County, Bellingham draws scores of notable acts
            touring along the I-5 corrider due to its proximity to both Seattle and Vancouver, B.C., and it boasts a few
            notable cultural icons of its own.

            In many ways, Bellingham can be likened to the "Eugene of the North"; after all, its residents largely embrace 
            progressive politics, environmentalism, microbrews, and a particular flavor of "weirdness" that regional cities 
            and towns like Portland, Eugene, and Olympia relish and promote. Some, however, would argue that Bellingham, with
            about half of Eugene's population, enjoys greater scenic and cultural advantages.
