        <h4>And it's for good reason.</h4>
        <p>
            The fact that Bellingham was dubbed as such by a man fond of perambulating downtown in a peanut
            costume speaks volumes about this quirky, pacifist, staunchly liberal Pacific Northwest college
            town that straddles Puget Sound with the North Cascades and the picturesque mountains Baker and Shuksan
            looming in the backdrop. The most populous city in Whatcom County, Bellingham draws scores of notable acts
            touring along the I-5 corrider due to its proximity to both Seattle and Vancouver, B.C., and it boasts a few
            notable cultural icons of its own.

            In many ways, Bellingham can be likened to the "Eugene of the North"; after all, its residents largely embrace
            progressive politics, environmentalism, microbrews, and a particular flavor of "weirdness" that regional cities
            and towns like Portland, Eugene, and Olympia relish and promote. Some, however, would argue that Bellingham, with
            about half of Eugene's population, enjoys greater scenic and cultural advantages.
